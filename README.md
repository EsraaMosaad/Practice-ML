Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains Python code to predict heart disease using various machine learning algorithms.

Key functionalities:

# Data Preprocessing:
Loads the heart disease dataset from a CSV file.[https://github.com/kb22/Heart-Disease-Prediction/blob/master/README.md]
Handles missing values (if any).
Identifies and handles categorical features through one-hot encoding.
Standardizes numerical features using StandardScaler.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Provides basic summary statistics about the data.
Generates visualizations to understand the relationships between features and the target variable (heart disease presence).
Machine Learning Model Training and Evaluation:
Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Implements and trains five machine learning models for classification:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Decision Tree Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
Evaluates the performance of each model using accuracy score and classification report.
Creates a bar chart to compare the accuracy scores of the models.
